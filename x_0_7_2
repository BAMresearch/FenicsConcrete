    getEigenpair(self, i: int, Vr: Vec = None, Vi: Vec = None)
    
    Gets the i-th solution of the eigenproblem as computed by
    `solve()`.  The solution consists of both the eigenvalue and
    the eigenvector.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    i: int
       Index of the solution to be obtained.
    Vr: Vec
        Placeholder for the returned eigenvector (real part).
    Vi: Vec
        Placeholder for the returned eigenvector (imaginary part).
    
    Returns
    -------
    e: scalar (possibly complex)
       The computed eigenvalue.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The index ``i`` should be a value between ``0`` and
    ``nconv-1`` (see `getConverged()`). Eigenpairs are indexed
    according to the ordering criterion established with
    `setWhichEigenpairs()`.
